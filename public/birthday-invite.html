<p> This will be a massive battle between two European powerhouses who have been underwhelming so far in the tournament. Although Portugal has been decent in patches, the form of Cristiano Ronaldo has been a concern.<br/>The 39-year-old is yet to find the net in the Euro 2024, which is his longest barren streak in a major tournament for Portugal. His only goal-scoring contribution came in the 3-0 win over Turkiye when Ronaldo assisted Bruno Fernandes for a goal. Against Slovenia, things got worse for Ronaldo whose spot kick in extra time was saved. A teary-eyed Ronaldo was visibly distraught but managed to back himself up and scored from the spot during the tie-breaker.
